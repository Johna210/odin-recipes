    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried â€” yummy! You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>vegetable oil (for frying and for the batter)</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>An Egg</li>
        <li>Pancake mix</li>
        <li>package of Oreos (regular and Double Stuf Oreos both work great)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
